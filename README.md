## About

Application is implemented with BLoC architecture, where Cubit is chosen as a base class for blocs.


#### Notice:
- Use of Either/Option, nice way of error handling without propagating stacktrace

#### Known flows:
- Using one model between Network and Domain layers 😱
- Using a bit of a random icons for living area and ground area, hope u don't mind 🤷‍♀️
- I didn't do proper text styling, just added TextStyleExtension for consistence. Didn't want to bother without having a UI kit
- Was lazy to parse ur data format, so no dates in the app
