Funda flutter assignment

## About

Application is implemented with BLoC architecture, where Cubit is chosen as a base class for blocs.


#### Notice:
- I use either/option here along with my own extensions, cause I think it's a nice approach and I want to share it with you :)

#### Known flows:
- Using one model between Network and Domain layers 😱
- Using a bit of a random icons for living area and ground area, hope u don't mind 🤷‍♀️
- I didn't do proper text styling, just added TextStyleExtension for consistence. Didn't want to bother without having a UI kit
- Was lazy to parse ur data format, so no dates in the app
- API key is hardcoded, should be injected, preferably on CI 🔑
- Image placeholder is missing
- Didn't implement localization

I don't think solving above tasks would show skill too much, so I omitted it to save time.
I invested in what is more important imo - architecture, scalability and code clarity.
UI is also ok-ish I think 😊
